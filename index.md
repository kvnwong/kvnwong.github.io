# Welcome to the Guide on The Twitch Clip API

Have you've ever made a sweet play in your game that you just wish the whole world could see? Get a headshot from across the map? Come back from a 3-1 deficit? Well, by combining Twitch's free video streaming services and the power of their video embedding API, you'll be able to share those rare moments on your site or page and this is the guide to get you started! 

With Twitch's video embedding API, users are able to pull saved clips from any game or channel, including their own.  

By the end of this tutorial and with a little help from AJAX, you should be able to embed any of your twitch clips on your own site, like the example below.

## Getting Started
