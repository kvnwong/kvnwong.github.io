## Welcome to the Guide on The Twitch API

Have you've ever made a sweet move in your game that you just wish the whole world could see? Get a headshot from across the map? Come back from a 3-1 deficit? Well, by combining Twitch's free video streaming services and the power of their video embedding API, you'll be able to share those rare moments on your site or page and this is the guide to get you started! 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kvnwong/kvnwong.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
